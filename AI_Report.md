## What I asked the AI to help with
- Generate a complete Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind project skeleton.

## Human work required / manual steps I performed
- Followed ChatGPT instructions to write and organize code.
- Created a TMDB account and obtained an API key.
- Created a GitHub repository and pushed the initial commit.
- Configured the environment variable `TMDB_API_KEY` in Vercel.
- Verified images load correctly and adjusted `next.config.js` for domains.
- Used ChatGPT mainly to resolve minimal doubts and clarify implementation details.
